How it Works:
OGG files (music file type supported by hoi4) by default have 
two audio channels (left and right), termed stereo or dual channel.

Stereo Recording was only introduced in the 1950s, long after
most of these songs were recorded so the left and right channel
contain the same data. By converting these files to mono channel,
we can see a ~50% reduction in file size without having an effect
on the listening experience.
